What is Scope 2?,TOOL_PROTOCOL_QA,TOOL_PROTOCOL_QA,True,Scope 2 accounts for GHG emissions from the generation of purchased electricity consumed by the company. Purchased electricity is defined as electricity that is purchased or otherwise brought into the organizational boundary of the company. These emissions physically occur at the facility where the electricity is generated. Scope 2 emissions are a special category of indirect emissions. Companies are required to account for and report on Scope 2 emissions at a minimum.,0.9,0.8,The agent's response is factually accurate in its description of Scope 2 emissions but omits explicit mention of the GHG Protocol and steam/heating/cooling.

## Classification Analysis of Scope 2 Emissions

This analysis assesses the classification of the company's reported Scope 2 emissions based solely on the provided GHG Protocol excerpt.

**Step 1: Defining Scope 2 according to the GHG Protocol**

The GHG Protocol defines Scope 2 as ""indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased electricity consumed by the company.""  The key elements are:

* **Indirect:** The emissions happen at the electricity generation facility, not within the company's operational boundary.
* **Purchased Electricity:** The electricity must be purchased or otherwise brought into the company's organizational boundary.

**Step 2: Analyzing Each Activity**

**Activity: Electricity**

* **Emission Factors:** 0.312, 0.334, 0.39, 0.421 kg CO2e/ton
* **Classification:** Correctly classified under Scope 2.  The emission factors relate directly to the generation of electricity purchased and consumed by the company, fulfilling both criteria outlined in the GHG Protocol definition.  The multiple emission factors likely reflect different sources of purchased electricity with varying generation mixes and associated emissions intensities.

**Activity: Steam**

* **Emission Factor:** 0.074 kg CO2e/ton
* **Classification:**  Potentially Incorrectly classified under Scope 2. The GHG Protocol explicitly limits Scope 2 to emissions from *purchased electricity*.  While steam generation can result in GHG emissions, it is not directly covered under the Scope 2 definition unless the steam is generated *from purchased electricity*. If the steam is generated on-site (e.g., from a company-owned boiler), the emissions should be classified under Scope 1 (if the combustion happens within the company's operational boundary) or potentially Scope 2 if the steam is generated from purchased electricity,  or Scope 3 (if it is part of a wider indirect emission activity).  Further information is needed to accurately classify the steam emissions.


**Step 3: Conclusion**

Based solely on the provided GHG Protocol excerpt and data, the ""Electricity"" activity is correctly classified under Scope 2.  However, the classification of the ""Steam"" activity is uncertain and requires additional information to determine if it is Scope 1, Scope 2, or Scope 3. To validate the company's Scope 2 calculations, a thorough investigation of the steam generation process is necessary to ascertain its accurate GHG Protocol classification.  The company must document the source of its steam and provide clear traceability for the applied emission factors. This documentation will then facilitate the correct calculation of Scope 2 (if appropriate) and other relevant scopes.

How does my Scope 1 emission compare with Peer 1?,TOOL_COMPARISON,TOOL_COMPARISON,True,"### Comparison for 

ANALYSIS AND INSIGHTS for Comparison for :

Our company's emissions (374,485.51 tonnes) significantly exceed those of its peers.  Peer 1 reported 132,510.10 tonnes, and Peer 2 reported a considerably lower 47,923.00 tonnes.  This represents a substantial gap, indicating a potential area for improvement in our environmental performance.


**Key Insights:**

1. **Significant Emission Disparity:**  Our company's emissions are substantially higher than those of our peers, suggesting a need for a comprehensive review of our operations to identify sources of high emissions and implement reduction strategies.  Further investigation is required to understand the root causes of this discrepancy and to determine the appropriate benchmarks for future reduction targets.

2. **Competitive Disadvantage:** The higher carbon footprint could present a competitive disadvantage, particularly if stakeholders (investors, customers, regulators) increasingly prioritize environmental sustainability.  This disparity warrants immediate attention and the development of a robust sustainability plan to mitigate risks and enhance our corporate reputation.

**1. Executive Summary**

Total greenhouse gas emissions across the requested scopes (Scopes 1 & 3) amounted to 376,177.98 tonnes of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e).  Scope 3 emissions overwhelmingly dominate, representing 99.5% of the total.

**2. Emissions Breakdown**

* **Scope 1 Emissions (1,692.47 tCO2e):** These direct emissions represent a negligible portion of the overall total.  The breakdown by fuel type is as follows:

    * Coal: 895.40 tCO2e
    * Cement Production: 702.00 tCO2e
    * Gasoline: 32.45 tCO2e
    * Refrigerants: 29.42 tCO2e
    * Diesel: 26.03 tCO2e
    * Natural Gas: 7.17 tCO2e

* **Scope 3 Emissions (374,485.51 tCO2e):**  Indirect emissions from value chain activities are the primary driver of the company's carbon footprint.  The top five contributors are:

    * Business Travel - Air: 46,312.07 tCO2e
    * IT Hardware: 45,226.26 tCO2e
    * Product Use Phase: 40,650.09 tCO2e
    * Inbound Logistics - Truck: 37,770.14 tCO2e
    * Manufacturing Equipment: 37,587.76 tCO2e


**3. Key Insights and Observations**

* **Scope 3 Dominance:** The vast majority of emissions originate from Scope 3 activities, highlighting the need for focused strategies to mitigate these indirect emissions.
* **High-Impact Scope 3 Categories:** Business travel (air), IT hardware, product use phase, inbound logistics (truck), and manufacturing equipment represent the most significant contributors to Scope 3 emissions and should be prioritized for reduction efforts.
* **Relative Insignificance of Scope 1:** While Scope 1 emissions should still be monitored, their relatively low contribution suggests that efforts to reduce Scope 3 emissions will have a much greater impact on the overall carbon footprint.

Explain and show me how to calculate it.,"TOOL_PROTOCOL_QA, TOOL_SQL_QUERY","TOOL_PROTOCOL_QA, TOOL_SQL_QUERY",True,"Employee business travel should be classified as Scope 3 emissions. The context lists ""Employee business travel"" under ""Transport-related activities,"" and discusses it as an emission type service sector companies may want to report, aligning with the description of Scope 3 activities, which are emissions from sources not owned or controlled by the company.

To calculate these emissions, Scope 3 GHG emissions will primarily be calculated from activity data such as fuel use or passenger miles and published or third-party emission factors.
